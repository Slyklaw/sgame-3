Prompt:

Let's make a two-player turn-based board game named "Sabotage".
It should be playable on mobile devices and desktop browsers.
Use a modern dark color theme.
Use Expo SDK for React Native.
Use the modern commands npm/npx for cli tooling.
Be sure to give instructions for initial project setup and to install any necessary dependencies.
It should look like a classic board game along the lines of checkers or chess.
At the top of the screen, in the middle, display the current player's piece.
Add a counter to each side of the screen that displays how many pieces each player still has on board.
In the upper-left corner, display "Player 1" and his score.
In the upper-right corner, display "Player 2" and his score.
In the top center, display who's turn it is.
A Player's score is equal to the number of pieces he has on the board.
Give the squares a subtle checkerboard effect just for looks, it won't affect gameplay.
The board has 15 columns and 7 rows with square spaces.
We can refer to specific spots by a tuple (column, row) format using 0-based indexing.
The center spot is then (7, 3).
Make sure the whole game is centered and fully visible on the screen without any scrolling.
Assign each player a color with good contrast against the board.
The players start on opposite sides.
The center of the left side (3,3) is Player 1's Home.
The center of the right side (11,3) is Player 2's Home.
Color each Home the color of the cooresponding Player's color.
Each player starts with 4 pieces that begin adjacent to their Home (N, S, W, E of Home).
A Crown is placed in the center of the board.
The goal is to capture the Crown and return it Home.
There are 2 win conditions:
Condition 1, capture the Crown and return it Home.
Condition 2, eliminate all opponent pieces.
Use simple click/tap interface to select a piece, and then to select where to move the piece.
The piece can move in any straight cardinal direction, like a Queen in chess.
The distance moved must always equal the number of pieces in the column at the time the piece is selected.
The valid moves for distance N are (-N, -N), (-N, 0), (-N, +N), and so on.
Pieces may not move off the board, nor may they move where the moving Player already has a piece.
They may however move onto an opponent's piece.
When the piece to be moved is selected, highlight the legal destination moves.
When a piece lands on the Crown, that piece takes the Crown.
When a piece lands on the opponent's piece, the opponent's piece is removed from the board and the counter is updated.
When the game is won, proudly display a Winner banner, and show a Restart button to start a new game.
When Restart is clicked, clear the banner and reset the board and score to initial conditions.

Result:
Impressive.
A few adjustments to prompt needed:

Crown isn't a piece for purposes of movement range.
Display player with Crown.
Scale the board to fit the window, but keep board places square.
